# android_starwars_api

Simple 2-screen Android app using Retrofit to retrieve Star Wars characters from API and using Room to cache results for offline usage.
Maybe use Glide if needing to load any images via URL.


If I had more time I'd:
    Add more Unit tests
    Implement Dagger/Hilt depending on how big the project gets
    Allow user to filter/search/orderBy___
    Implement Firebase Crashlytics
    Implement multiple languages
    Implement multiple themes

    Speak to project owners and find out if they'd like the app to:
        Amend this API or use another API for getting images/thumbnails for the characters
        Have sections (ViewPager styled) so users can view more than just characters
        Extend to other popular movies/things
        Have some sort of paid feature available to logged in users
